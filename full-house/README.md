# FullHouse
Accurate Occupancy Monitoring: Ensuring Safety through Real-Time Headcounts

# Problem Stetement
The problem involves the manual counting of people in rooms within different environments such as offices, schools, or event venues. This manual counting process poses several challenges, including being time-consuming, prone to errors, inefficient in real-time scenarios, and difficult to maintain accurate counts when the number of people is dynamically changing. Therefore, there is a need for a more efficient and accurate solution to monitor and manage the occupancy of rooms in these environments, ensuring the security and safety of the occupants.
